# H.A.L.T
## Holistic Traffic Management System

### Problem
***

- Need for an effective way to manage traffic efficiently.
- To help increase the efficiency of Emergency Services.

### Proposed Solution
***

- IoT based Traffic Management System
- We have aimed at adding multiple sensors embedded on the road to determine the
  density of traffic waiting on a particular signal and accordingly control the traffic lights.
- Apart from this the red-light sensors also
has a receiver which detects a passing
emergency vehicle such as an ambulance
and get changed appropriately.

### Future Aspects 
***

- Implementation of OpenCV
